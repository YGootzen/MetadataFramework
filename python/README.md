# Python approach
This folder contains the object-oriented implementation in python. 

For new users, we recommend starting with the notebook classes_examples.ipynb. It contains examples and explanations of the most important concepts of the implementation. 

Case studies are applied in the notebook check_test_cases.ipynb. From within that notebook, you may select one of the existing test_case notebooks. The notebook test_case_mobility.ipynb contains all specifications required for the mobility use case. For implementing your own example, make a copy of test_case_mobility.ipynb and specify your own data, relations and models.

The notebook classes.ipynb contains all objects used in the implementation and may be interesting for precise definitions and further development.
