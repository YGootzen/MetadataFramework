    "# Small test cases\n",
    "This notebook contains test cases for the metadata framework. To load and solve these cases, go to the `check_test_cases` notebook. The test cases are not based on real data sources. They are constructed such that various puzzles arise, each focusing on a different solution. The small test cases contain five conversion graphs and five aggregation graphs."
