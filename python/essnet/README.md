# Python scripts for Metadata Analysis
This folder contains an object-oriented implementation of the metadata framework in python. 

For users interested in analysing a pre-defined case study, we recommend starting with the notebook case_essnet_user_friendly.ipynb. 

The above scenario is defined in the notebook case_essnet.ipynb. Before changing the case_essnet.ipynb notebook however, we recommend starting with the notebook examples.ipynb. It contains examples and explanations of the most important concepts of the implementation. 

For a version of the scripts used to create the output referenced in the article "A Framework for using Metadata to Combine Data Sets in Official Statistics" (currently under review), we refer to the folder python/jos_article/.
